Steps complete:
1. Check data set, learn columns, definitions, numbers etc and d/l from Kaggle
2. Make it into a pandas df:
	b) Goals scored per team DONE
	c) Wins per team DONE
3. Stats - use stats libraries to do this - make a histogram of wins/losses 

Steps failed:

4. Use API connector to dark sky to get the rain data - this worked until my code stopped working, not sure why

5. Append this data to the overall df - would have succeeded but code stopped running

6. Calc win % on days when raining - ""

7. Adding to MongoDB
